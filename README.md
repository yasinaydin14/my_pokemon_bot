# Pokémon Bot Project

This project allows you to **train and use a DQN-based Pokémon bot** for battles using the [Pokémon Showdown](https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown.git) platform.

---

## Features
- Train your own reinforcement learning Pokémon bot
- Connect and battle via Pokémon Showdown
- Modular structure for easy extension and experimentation

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone Pokémon Showdown
```bash
git clone https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown.git
cd pokemon-showdown
npm install
cp config/config-example.js config/config.js
node pokemon-showdown start --no-security

> The line “The server will run…” is **outside** the code block and will render as regular text.

---

If you want, I can **rewrite your full README snippet** with all Bash blocks properly closed so nothing appears inside them incorrectly.  

Do you want me to do that?
